# stunning-journey

Hello, 

My name is Teresa Maldonado and I am new Full-Stack Developer. This is the portfolio that I've created. 

I started with the styling because I had a very specific idea in my head that I wanted to achieve so I wanted to establish the styling before I put in the javascript. I wanted to make sure the styling is correct and to my liking before adding anything dynamic that could possible alter it. 

So I created all the initial landing pages and styled them to make sure they were cohesive and then proceeded to add dynamic styling to all them. 


## USE 
The purpose of this project is purely to create a portfolio for myself to display all of my work and allow an opportunity for potential employers to see my span of work.
